# Preclass Preparation

You will need to install a few applications on your computer for this course, set up what's called your *development environment*, and create SSH keys, or *Secure Shell* keys for access to GitHub.

Instructions are provided for Linux, Mac, and Windows computers, the three operating systems officially supported by this course material.

If you are not familiar with the command line, expect to spend a couple hours on this.

Refer to the
