# Week 3 - Homework

We are going to strengthen our bootstrap/html skills by copying another website. This one is going to be tougher that the last one so please reach out to me if you have any questions.

## Monday 10/8

Here is an image of the website to copy. This is going to be heavily dependent on using bootstrap rows and cols.

### Hint
- To get the black lines separating each section use border-left, border-right, and border-top

### Once You Are Done
Until I figure out the best way to have you upload the homework continue sending me the whole project folder through slack.
