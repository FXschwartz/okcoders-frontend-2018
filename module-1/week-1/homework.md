# Week 1 - Homework

We're going to a very simple home page for an animal adoption website for this week's homework.  Every day (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) will build on the previous. For a general guideline I will be displaying an image of what the page layout should look like. It will be up to you to figure out how to mimic the layout as well as adding in your own ideas, designs and making it your own.

Each assignment will be graded with 50% going toward it being completed and the other 50% from coding style(Code correctly spaced and indented, good naming conventions that make sense etc...)

- Day 1: Setup, Layout, table of animals
- Day 2: Animal info page
- Day 3: css and visual improvements

## Day 1 - Monday 9/24

### Setup
Create a new folder called `adoption-website`, this is where this weeks homework will live.
Create a new file inside of `adoption-website` called `home-page.html`

### Layout

We want our home page to have a 3 panel layout:
- A top area for our Website's title and future links
- A main area to display the list of animals available for adoption in a table format
- A bottom area to display the contact email address.

Here's an idea of what it should look like:

### Bonus
- Make the email address in the footer a clickable link that opens up your computers default email client when clicked on.

#### Hints
- Your home page doesn't have to look like mine at all, it just has to have the general layout.
- Remember that block elements like a `<div></div>` are great for headers and footers because they take up the full width of the page.
- Don't be afraid to play around with some css and experiment with new html tags.
- Finally, if you need help, reach out to me!  That's why I'm here.

### Once You Are Done
Next week I will have a better way for you to send me your completed assignments but for now after you are done with each one send the `adoption-website` folder to me in a private slack message.
