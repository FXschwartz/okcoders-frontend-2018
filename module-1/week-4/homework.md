# Week 4 - Final Project

We are going to finish our animal adoption website by adding a couple more features and also going back and making everything mobile friendly.

There will be two new things added:
1. A page showing all of the animals up for adoption. This needs to be setup as rows of boxes with the image of the animal inside. When hovered the image opacity should change and the name of the animal should appear.

2. Adding multiple images to our animal detail page. The images should be thumbnail size, until hovered over then they should grow to full size.

After that the last requirement is the entire website should be mobile friendly don't forget to add <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"> to your webpage.

This final project MUST be completed in order to get an OK Coders completion certificate. The last day to turn in this project is the Friday before the next module 10/26/18.

### Hint
- Hover will not work on mobile so you will have to come up with a way to always display the animal image and its name while making sure it looks good.

### Once You Are Done
Until I figure out the best way to have you upload the homework continue sending me the whole project folder through slack.
