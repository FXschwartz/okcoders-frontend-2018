# Week 1 Saturday 10/27 - Homework

We're going to build a couple of slightly complex applications.

1. The first will ask the user for a number and return whether or not it is an even or odd number.

2. The second should be a paper scissors rock game. It should ask the player for their move first and then randomly select the opposing move and display it with who won, as well as ask the player if they would like to play again.

3. The third one will start with an array of numbers [3,3,7,29,5,2,9]. I want you to loop through the array and display a prompt at each point in the array, display the number your inspecting with the current index in the array and let the user know where its even or not.

4. The fourth one will start with an array of numbers [3,3,7,29,5,2,9]. I want you to filter out all of the even numbers and assign them to their own array. By the end you will have your original array and then one more array with all of the even numbers.

5. The fifth one will start with an array of numbers [3,3,7,29,5,2,9]. I want you to sort the numbers by ascending and then descending. You should create a new variable for both of them.

### Bonus
- On number 3 once you have found the even number, move it to the end of the array.
