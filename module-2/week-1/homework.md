# Week 1 Saturday 10/27 - Homework

We're going to build a couple of very simple applications.

1. The first will ask the user for how much money they make in a week, once the user answers that it should ask the user what percentage of withholdings to take out. It should then calculate how much the user will make per year taking into account the percentage of holdings given.

2. The second should be a character count app. It should ask the user for whatever word they would like to count and then display the character count of the word provided.

3. The third and final one should ask the user for the year they were born and then ask for a future year to give. The app should then display how old the user will be in the year provide based on their birth year given before.

### Bonus
- On number 3 if the calculated age at the end is greater than 200, display a message asking if they need some medical attention.
