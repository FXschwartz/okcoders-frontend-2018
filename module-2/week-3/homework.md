# Week 3 Sunday 11/11 - Homework

We're going to get some more practice with using objects!

1. Prompt the user for their first name, last name, email, and phone number. With these values, create a new object using the values given by the user. Then console.log the new object to the chrome console.

2. Create a new object with a property called 'favoriteTypesOfFood', its value should be an array of your favorite types of food. Then create a function that loops through the array and alerts the user each type of food in the array.

3. The last one will be similar to an example we did in class. Prompt the user for their first name and last name and save the values into a new user object. Then create a function that adds a full name property to the user object using the given first name and last name values. Prompt the user their fullName and give them the option to edit their new full name.

### Bonus
- Prompt the user for their favorite types of animals. The user should type the entire list into one single prompt. Once the user is done, take the list of animals and turn it into an array of types of animals. Example - 'dog cat bird fish' should end up as '[dog, cat, bird, fish]'

### Hint
- On the bonus you should use a method called split(). Look it up on MDN to learn what it does and how to use it!
