# Week 1 Saturday 12/1 - Homework

We're going to build a very simple calculator application!.

1. We will build on this as we go along in the module but for now what we need to have is two input fields which will hold the two numbers we will be using. Then 4 buttons:
A + which will add the two numbers together and output the value to the user.
A - which will subtract the two numbers and output the value to the user.
A * which will multiple the two numbers and output the value to the user.
And finally a C which when clicked on should clear the all the values the user sees and start the process over.

The user should only be able to put numbers into the inputs.

### Bonus
- As a bonus use bootstrap to make the calculator app look like an actual calculator!
