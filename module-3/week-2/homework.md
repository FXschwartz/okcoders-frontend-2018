# Week 2 Saturday 12/8 - Homework

We're going to start our first website using all of the tools that we have learned in the class so far. It will be spread across the next weeks as we add more and more functionality and pages to it. Make sure to use bootstrap as your creating these pages so that they are both pretty and mobile friendly.

1. The first page (Login Page) will be the login page. I've posted a screenshot below of the layout I'm looking for. Overall design is up to you but it must be in the center of the screen, have a logo at the top, two input fields, and a login button. You should have one user that has a email address and password. Whenever a user clicks login you need to check the values of the email address and password and make sure they match. If they do match, use javascript to navigate the user to the home page. If they do not match, display a message to the user that their credentials are incorrect.

2. The second page (Home Page) for now will just be a very basic page with very little content. Eventually we will add more like a side navigation with links and images and text. For now just have a header with your websites name and logo and a logout button that takes the user back to the logout page.

Let me know if you need any help with anything and remember, everything must be mobile friendly!!

### HINT
- To navigate the user to another page using Javascript, google using location.href()
