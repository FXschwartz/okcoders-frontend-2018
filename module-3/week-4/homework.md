# Week 4 Saturday 12/22 - Final Homework

We're going to be finishing up our portfolio website with our final project!

1. Our final addition to the portfolio website will be a tip calculator. You should have an input field where the user can input the total bill cost. Then a dropdown that has options as too how you would rate the service (poor,good,excellent...). Each option should change the tip percentage that is used. Then a calculate button at the button that will give you the total amount you should tip.

Let me know if you need any help with anything and remember, everything must be mobile friendly!!

### BONUS
- Add a second input field that asks the user how many people are splitting the bill. Then when clicking calculate split the total between the number of people given.
