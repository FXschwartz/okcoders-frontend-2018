# Week 3 Saturday 12/15 - Homework

We're going to build on top of our portfolio website! Right now you should have your login page, home page with links that go to your projects. The only project you should have at this point is your calculator.

1. We are going to add a shopping list app to our portfolio, you should add a link to your navigation that will direct the user to your shopping list app. Your shopping list app should have an input field for the name of the item and and input field for its price. As well as a button to add the item to the list. Whenever the user hovers on top of a listed item two buttons should appear, one will let the user mark it as picked up and put a line through the item to show it as completed. The second should be a delete button that removes it from the list.

Let me know if you need any help with anything and remember, everything must be mobile friendly!!

### BONUS
- On the shopping list app, show the total price of all the items. Whenever an item is added it should update the total as well as whenever an item is removed.
